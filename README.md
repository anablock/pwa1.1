ReactDOM has a function called render, which takes two arguments: the React element to be rendered to the screen (hey, we have that already!), and the HTML element it will be rendered inside.
Then, in our ReactDOM.render function, weâ€™ll pass in the React element, and then use document.getElementById to grab our new div.
To do:
* yarn add webpack@3.5.4
* node_modules/.bin/webpack src/index.js public/bundle.js
